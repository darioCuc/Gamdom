# Gamdom QA Automation Project Setup

## Getting Started

To clone this repository and run the tests:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]` or extract it from the provided `.zip` file
2. Navigate using terminal to the repository directory: `cd ~/Users/Gamdom`
3. Install Playwright locally: `pnpm install playwright`
4. Run the tests: `npx playwright test`

## Setup

### 1. Playwright and TypeScript Installation

- Initialized the `Playwright` framework for end-to-end testing.
- Installed `TypeScript` to enhance code quality and maintainability.

### 2. ESLint Integration

- Integrated ESLint for consistent coding standards.
- Configured ESLint to work seamlessly with TypeScript.

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration

- Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.
- Automated testing workflows established using Playwright's provided setup.

### 4. Project Structure Updates

- Added a `pages` folder following the Page Object Model principle, containing multiple `.ts` files for different pages on the Gamdom site.
- Created an `Additional-testing-Files` folder, which includes:
  - `TASK1.md`: Documents the 5 key areas critical for business functionality identified during exploratory testing.
  - `Bug Report - Gamdom.pdf`: Details a bug found on the Gamdom production page during exploratory testing.

### 5. Configuration and Credentials

- Added a `tsconfig.json` file to specify the root files and compiler options for the TypeScript project, enhancing project structure and compilation settings.
- Introduced a `userCredentials.json` file for storing user login details to attempt automated login. Noted the challenge of automating the login flow due to captcha verification and the need for login tokens from the development team.

### 6. Decisions made in development process

- Added a skip function in the 1st login test due to CAPTCHA limitations.
- Increased the viewport size in `playwright.config.ts` to adapt to responsive design elements in the topbar.

### 7. Test Reports

- A new folder `Gamdom-test-reports` has been added to store test run reports, providing detailed insights on each test execution.

### 8. Observations

- Gamdom website is not test automation friendly due to the fact that it has a low number of `data-testIds` or any type of IDs that spped up the test develpment process and reliability.
